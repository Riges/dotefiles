# Rigesâ€™s dotfiles

ðŸš§ I change and merge from this basic dotfiles and an older scripted dotfiles into this dotfiles repository, with better organization and scripted developer station installation. I start with my work laptops on macOS and I will add Linux (with wsl2) and Windows later.

## Thanks
